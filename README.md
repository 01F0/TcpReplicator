# TcpReplicator
A C# class created for mocking TCP data. The TCP server will reply with the data you provide it with. All focus is put on the replies, the client input gets fully ignored.

# How to use
The source code was created for [scriptcs](http://scriptcs.net/) but can easily be moved to a C# project.

To run it as it is:

`scriptcs Example.csx`
